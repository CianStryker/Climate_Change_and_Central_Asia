# Climate Change in Central Asia Project

This paper was the final project of my "Spatial Models of Social Science" at Harvard University. This course functioned as an introduction to GIS software with a focus on ArcGIS Pro. I chose to dedicate my final project to studying Climate Change's effect on Central Asia by using Modis NDVI satellite data. All analyses and maps were created with ArcGIS Pro. The Modis Data used in this project was taken from USGS (United States Geography Services), which can be found at their Earth Explorer website [here.](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov).
